  uv tool install huggingface_hub

# The `hf models info` JSON is parsed with the stdlib `json` module, not a text scan --
# huggingface_hub 1.28 prints it as one compact line rather than the pretty-printed,
# one-key-per-line form an earlier `tr | awk '/^sha:/'` scan assumed, and that scan
# silently found nothing against compact output. `json` needs no import of
# huggingface_hub itself, so it does not hit the isolated-environment problem above.
# NOTE: json.load reads its input to EOF, so `hf` still runs to completion rather than
# taking SIGPIPE from an early-exiting consumer under `set -o pipefail`.
